1. These applications are made using Racket Language so install it before trying to run them. 

2. Install the District Pro font by using the 'DistProTh.otf' in the same directory for better visual fonts.

3. Install the 'RSound' package using 'raco pkg install rsound' command in the terminal. Without this, the file will flag an error during compile! We love sounds right.

4. To play the multiplayer game, one of the two players should be a host, and the host should click the 'RUN' in the pop-up of Multiplayer-LAN before entering the IP-address and Name. The IP-address should correspond to that of host. Once, you are ready, the host should 'FIRST' press 'PLAY' only after which the next player should press the 'PLAY' button. The grid-size is automatically decided by the host settings.

5. To run the game, compile the game.rkt file!

ALL SET! PLAY NOW! HAVE FUN :)
